export const BIO = [
  "My journey into engineering began at the age of ten when my dad challenged me to build a rubber band gun using tree branches we collected from the backyard. From that moment, \
  I was hooked‚Äîcaptivated by the process of transforming ideas into reality and bridging the gap between imagination and the tangible world through creative problem-solving.",

  "Fast forward to today, I‚Äôm pursuing a major in Computer Engineering and a minor in Cybersecurity, a decision I consider one of the best I‚Äôve made in my life. At school, I‚Äôve been fortunate \
  to meet an incredible group of friends, with whom I‚Äôve worked on a wide range of projects. Through these experiences, I‚Äôve learned engineering is not only about technical expertise \
  and finishing every sprint but also about effective communication and building strong relationships with the people you collaborate with.",

  "Over the summer of my second year, I worked full-time as an Embedded Systems Software Engineer at Aquivio and as a Software Engineer Intern at WOD. By day, I troubleshot circuits, \
  designed PCBs, and developed embedded systems. By night, I built APIs and structured database schemas for efficient query operations. It was indeed a challenging time but extremely \
  rewarding. In the following year, I took on a full-time role at Bright Toward Industrial as an R&D Engineer while completing my military service in Taiwan. During this period, I gained \
  in-depth knowledge of semiconductor manufacturing and led the development of various test systems from the ground up. I also contributed to improving operational efficiency by building \
  a full-stack app that automated the company‚Äôs data processing workflow. These experiences solidified my expertise in both hardware and software engineering and taught me the value of \
  adaptability and innovation in problem-solving.",

  "Outside of work, I‚Äôm an avid sports enthusiast. I‚Äôve been playing ice hockey for over sixteen years and served as captain of the U18 and U20 National Team in 2020 and 2022 to compete in IIHF World Championships. \
  I‚Äôm also passionate about diving, having spent four months working as a scuba and freediving instructor on Liuqiu Island, located off the southwest coast of Taiwan, before starting college. When I‚Äôm not \
  working or playing sports, you‚Äôll likely find me immersed in a good book or watching a Christopher Nolan film at the theater :)",
